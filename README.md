# UMBC Bookstore

This project was for my final in my scripting and markup class (IS448) at UMBC, this was also my first exposure to building a full-stack app! The project is designed to mimic a bookstore website for UMBC students, allowing users to explore, review, and comment on various books. The application has both frontend and backend components, using Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend and PHP with MariaDB for the backend.

## Features

- **Book Search:**
  - Users can search for books based on title and genre.
  - The search functionality provides a quick and efficient way to find specific books.

- **Book Details:**
  - Each book has its own details page, displaying information such as title, author, genre, and a description.
  - Users can leave reviews and comments for each book.

- **Admin Page:**
  - Admins have access to a barebones admin page.
  - Admins can approve or decline comments for each book, helping to maintain content quality.
  - Admins can add new categories and books to expand the bookstore's catalog.
